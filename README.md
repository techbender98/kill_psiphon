# kill_psiphon
Program to stop / prevent psiphon3 working on windows devices


These executable files prevent psiphon creating its dependancy executables on start up. If the program is still named 'Psiphon' or a variant of that, the initial program itself will also be shut down.

The python script contains the raw code used to create the executable.

Deployment requires adding the program to shell:startup
I recommend changing the name of the program prior to deployment.

The windowed exe shows what the program is catching
The noconsole exe is a silent program.

No students were harmed in the making of this program
